FlyoutTest
==========

This repo tests out some code to try and show a MenuFlyout shown from a button on another Flyout.

It looks like the secondary flyout dismisses the parent / preview one. Is there a way to avoid that? 

Using Callisto with very similar code in Win 8, it works. Using the native flyout in Win 8.1 - it doesn't.

How can we fix this?
